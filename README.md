# üö© Did I Dodge a Bullet?

Post-interview red flag bingo for the quietly suspicious.

You just finished an interview. You're not sure how to feel. Something was... off. But it wasn't overt enough to call a red flag-just that quiet little tug in your gut.

**Did I Dodge a Bullet?** is a simple, self-guided bingo experience that helps you unpack those moments. It's a subtle, slightly cynical, and deeply honest tool for reflecting on interviews before you sign a contract you'll regret.

## üéØ What It Is

A web-based 3x3 bingo board, filled with **research-backed red flags** pulled from real-world interview experiences on Reddit, Glassdoor, and job seeker communities-like:

- "They described the team as a 'family'"
- "Recruiter bombards with 45 texts & 15 calls in 3 days"
- "They ask if you work weekends for free"
- "Office feels tense-no one smiles"

You click the ones you experienced. Get a bingo? You might've dodged a bullet.
